        <section class="mb-4">
            <h2>Body of the Lesson</h2>
            <p><strong>1. The Nature of Faith:</strong> Faith goes beyond mere belief; it requires action and complete trust in God. It is not rooted in what we see but in the assurance of God's promises (Hebrews 11:6).</p>
            <p><strong>2. Examples of Faith in the Bible:</strong> The Bible is filled with accounts of individuals who demonstrated faith. Noah built the ark when there was no sign of rain. Abraham was willing to sacrifice Isaac because of his trust in God’s plan. Each example shows faith in action.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Living by Faith Today:</strong> Faith manifests in our daily lives through obedience to God's Word, prayer, and perseverance during trials. Faith requires stepping out of our comfort zones and believing God’s Word above all else.</p>
